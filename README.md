# Low-Power Person Detection for UAV Search and Rescue Operations

This repository contains the code and documentation for the `Low-Power Person Detection for UAV Search and Rescue Operations` project in TinyML for the Stockholm University by [Gabriele Pattarozzi](https://github.com/gpatta), [Timon Coucke](https://github.com/LGDTimtou) and [Jakub Schwenkbeck](https://github.com/JakubSchwenkbeck)



This repository is organized as follows:

- documents/ - project plan and report
- output/ - benchmarking results and plots
- models/ - final trained models and exported artifacts
- src/ - source code:
  - src/optimizing/ - model optimization scripts 
  - src/training/ - training code and dataset preparation
  - src/visualization/ - plotting and visualization utilities
  - src/runtime/ - inference/runtime code for deployment on Hardware
- notebooks/pipeline.ipynb - comprehensive pipeline walkthrough (model loading → training → optimization → benchmarking).


For a quick idea what we did, take a look at this demo video:

## Instructions


### Model Optimization

Create a Python (3.11) virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv opt_venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source opt_venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r src/optimizing/requirements.txt
```

### Model Runtime

Create a Python (3.11) virtual environment that includes the system site packages for picamera2 support:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements and force reinstall for incompatible system site packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
